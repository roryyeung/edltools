# EDL Tools

This is a simple set of python tools designed to import a range of EDL (Edit Decision Lists) and EDL-like formats (e.g. AAF) and allow for their manipulation.

The reader functions in this package take an EDL (or EDL-like file), and returns an object of class EDL. This object contains a range of methods, to allow the data contained to be manipulated or outputted.

Potential use cases for this package include converting EDLs to Excel, performing file searches for all files contained within an EDL, and providing a bridge between NLE (Non-Linear Editing) software and third-party tools.
